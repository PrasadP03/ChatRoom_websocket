This project is a basic implementation of a chatroom using WebSocket in Spring Boot with Thymeleaf.
I'm currently learning WebSocket technology, and this project is aimed at understanding the fundamentals of real-time communication between a client and server.
It's a simple application designed for educational purposes, allowing me to explore how WebSocket connections work and how to integrate them with a Spring Boot backend and a Thymeleaf frontend.
